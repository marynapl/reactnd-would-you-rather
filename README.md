# Would You Rather App

This is a web app that lets a user play the "Would you rather?" game. The user is able to:

* answer questions in the form: "Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?"
* see answered and unaswered questions
* post a question 
* see how other users have voted
* see the ranking of users on the leaderboard

## TL;DR

To get started:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Data

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data.

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

* Users
* Questions
